The acknowledgment number is 0 because no segment has ever been received from PC2.\n\tAfter receiving a valid TCP segment with the SYN flag being set, the receiver (PC2) replies with a TCP segment with SYN and ACK being set. The initial sequence number b is a randomly generated number. Because the segment is a response one to PC1, the acknowledgment number is a+1.\n\tAfter receiving the TCP segment in which SYN and ACK are set, PC1 replies with a segment in which ACK is set, the sequence number is a+1, and the acknowledgment number is b+1. After PC2 receives the segment, a TCP connection is established.\n",
